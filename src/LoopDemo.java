		 * What is a loop structure:
		 * A loop structure is a structure that repeats a section of code. 
		 * All programming languages have them in some form.
		 * 
		 * There are two classification of loops you want to know:
		 * 
		 * COUNTED LOOP:
		 * 		A counted loop is typically used when you know in advance how many times the loop should run.
		 * 
		 * 		for (<count>; <check>; <change>) {

		 * 
		 * 		4. (true) Run loop code
